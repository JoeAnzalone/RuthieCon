RuthieCon Unconference Scheduler
================================

The RuthieCon Unconference Scheduler is an unconference scheduling web app that lets users list their talk/workshop/activity/performance for other attendees to peruse.

Users are required to RSVP to the unconference's Facebook event page before being allowed to view any of the listings.

The RuthieCon Unconference Scheduler was created by [Joe Anzalone](http://JoeAnzalone.com) for Ruthie's birthday.
